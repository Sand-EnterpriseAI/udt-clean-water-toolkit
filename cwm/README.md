# cleanwater module

## 1. Requirements

### 1.1 Packages

- geopandas
- numpy
- momepy
- matplotlib
- networkx

These packages can be installed with the instructions in Section 2.


## 2. Development

TODO: add independent development.

For the time being It's easiest to develop this module when integrated in another application. 

First you will need to build a wheel of the module:

```
python3 -m pip install build

python3 -m build --wheel
```

Then see [app development](../cwa/cwa_geodjango/README.md#2-development) for how to run the module.


## 3. Tests
